/ramen/ (ラーメン) is a windowing library primarily designed for use in game engines and similar performance-critical real-time applications. It is also intended to act as a reference for implementations of graphics windowing in other languages, and to document otherwise poorly or plain undocumented APIs.

* Features
- =input= :: Enabled by default, provides events for keyboard and mouse input.
- =parking-lot= :: Replaces the synchronisation primitives with those from [[https://github.com/Amanieu/parking_lot][parking_lot]] for improved performance. Recommended in release mode.
* Building
/ramen/ is purposefully minimal on dependencies, so for the most part, you'll be able to just add it as a dependency for your project with no extra hassle. To build with the X11 backend (usually when building for Linux), you'll need the *development files* installed for the following libraries:
- libX11
- libxcb
If the =input= feature is enabled:
- libxcb-xinput
- libxkbcommon
The corresponding libraries will also need to be installed on the target machine - otherwise you'll get an =Unsupported= error from =Connection::new()=.
* Licence
Due to the proprietary nature of games, ramen is available under the short and permissive [[./LICENCE.org][zlib/libpng licence]].
