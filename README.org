ramen (ラーメン) is a windowing library primarily designed for use in game engines and similar performance-critical real-time applications. It is also intended to act as a reference for implementations of graphics windowing in other languages, and documents otherwise poorly or plain undocumented APIs.

* Features
- =parking-lot= :: Replaces the synchronisation primitives with those from [[https://github.com/Amanieu/parking_lot][parking_lot]] for improved performance. Recommended in release mode.
* Licence
Due to the proprietary nature of games, ramen is available under the short and permissive [[./LICENCE.org][zlib/libpng licence]].
